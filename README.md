# concoction

Concoction is a web application that allows the user to search for any cocktail and it will show the name, ingredients, instructions, and a picture of the drink.  It also has the functionality of rendering a random cocktail with the name, ingredients, instructions, and picture.  With this app you can search how to make your favorite drinks or be inspired to make a new one with the different variations of the drink you are searching for or one at random.

The troubles I had with this app was the looping through all the ingredients and filtering out all the null and undefined ones and rendering the ingredients to the page.

In the future I would add a video showing how the drink is made.  Add in some sort of link on where to buy the ingredients or barware needed.

The technologies I used for this application are: html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, and the cocktail db api.

Concoction can be launched from the following link: https://byeager999.github.io/concoction/

I acted as the developer for this project.
